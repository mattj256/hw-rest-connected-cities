- change gs-wrapper-xxx to my application name
- Spring Boot Batch Job
- change varchar in DB schema, or note it as a limitation
- error handling
- unit tests

Limitations
===

I'm storing the password in plaintext, which is a clear security risk (and a violation of the 12-Factor Application rules).

Room for optimization: unionFind, unionFind.queue, unionFind.forkJoin, etc.
Writing algo.unionFind back to the database can be a significant up-front cost for large databases.

Introduction
===

I took the original skeleton from:
https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service/
Batch processing skeleton from:
https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-batch-processing.git
